// STL --> standard template library
// stl containers --> vectors, queue, stacks, hashmaps etc


/*
The Code runs in two phases
1 - compile time
2 - running stage (execution)

There is 2 types of memory
1 - Stack Memory
2 - Heap Memory

Static VS Dynamic memory allocation
1 - Static memory - gets allocated in compile time (int arr[5])
2 - Dynamic memory - gets allocated in running time (increasing size of vector)

How vector is initialized in memory?
It's just an array
It has two properties 1-size 2-capacity
Every time the capacity gets doubled when there is no space for another el in array
thats how vec inc their size dynamically
